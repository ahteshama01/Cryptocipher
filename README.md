Overview:-

This web page provides an interactive tool for basic cryptographic operations. Users can encrypt and decrypt text using a Caesar cipher, with a customizable shift value.

Features:-
Text Encryption: Convert plaintext to ciphertext using a Caesar cipher

Text Decryption: Convert ciphertext back to plaintext

Customizable Shift Value: Adjust the cipher shift (1-25)

Clean Interface: Simple, user-friendly design

Real-time Processing: Instant encryption/decryption as you type

How to Use:-
Enter your text in the "Input Text" field

Adjust the shift value using the slider (default: 3)

Click "Encrypt" to convert to ciphertext or "Decrypt" to convert to plaintext

View the result in the output field

Technical Details
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Uses a Caesar cipher algorithm (substitution cipher)

Each letter is shifted through the alphabet by the specified number

Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged

Browser Compatibility:-
Works on all modern browsers including:

Chrome

Firefox

Safari

Edge

Security Note:-
This implementation is for educational purposes only. The Caesar cipher provides minimal security and should not be used for sensitive data protection.
